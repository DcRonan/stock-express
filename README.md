## Description

> I have created a web-application that lets you check the stock market while all information is being retrieved from an API.

![screenshot](./public/assets/main-sc.png)

I have built this responsive SPA (Single Page Application) using React, Redux and Tailwind CSS. I added pagination to handle large amounts of data and an option to filter the stocks by searching.
